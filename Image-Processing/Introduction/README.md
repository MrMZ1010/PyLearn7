# OpenCV Projects

This repository contains a collection of OpenCV projects that demonstrate various image processing techniques. Below is a brief description of each project along with instructions on how to run them.

## Table of Contents

1. [Character 'M' Image](#character-m-image)
2. [Black Tape on Image](#black-tape-on-image)
3. [Chess Board Pattern](#chess-board-pattern)
4. [Gradient Image](#gradient-image)
5. [Image Rotation](#image-rotation)
6. [Image Inversion](#image-inversion)

## Character 'M' Image

This project creates an 800x800 white image with the character 'M' drawn using black rectangles.

## Black Tape on Image

This project reads an image, resizes it, converts it to grayscale, and adds a black diagonal line.

## Chess Board Pattern

This project creates an 8x8 chessboard pattern using a 560x560 image.

## Gradient Image

This project creates a 255x255 gradient image where the intensity decreases from top to bottom.

## Image Rotation

This project reads an image, resizes it, rotates it by 180 degrees, and then displays and saves the modified image.

## Image Inversion

This project reads an image and inverts its colors, creating a negative effect.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Install OpenCV if you haven't already by running:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python
    ```
3. Place the required images (`simons.jpg`, `sad-men.jpg`, `woman.jpg`) in the same directory as the script files.
4. Run each script using a Python interpreter. For example:
    ```bash
    python script_name.py
    ```
   Replace `script_name.py` with the name of the script you want to run.

Enjoy exploring these OpenCV projects!
